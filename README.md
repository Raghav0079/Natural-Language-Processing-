## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an integral domain in AI, dealing with the interaction between computers and human language. This repository focuses on building end-to-end NLP solutions that emphasize advanced techniques such as:

- **Word Embedding**: Representing textual data in numerical format to capture semantic relationships.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) RNN**: Modeling sequential data for tasks like text analysis and classification.
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Enhancing context understanding by processing sequences both forward and backward.

These techniques are implemented to create robust NLP models for practical applications, as demonstrated in the projects included here.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bidirectional LSTM RNN

This project demonstrates the use of a **Bidirectional LSTM RNN** to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It builds robust NLP models capable of understanding text context, both forward and backward in sequences.

**Key Details:**
- **Objective**: Train a Bidirectional LSTM model to process text sequences and predict target labels.
- **Data**: Input data preprocessed using `nltk`, tokenized, and converted into word embeddings for efficient representation.
- **Model**: A TensorFlow-based model with Bidirectional LSTM layers, trained to recognize patterns in text.
- **Output**: The trained model can accurately predict outcomes based on the provided textual data.

### 2. Fake News Classification Using TensorFlow

This project focuses on **classifying fake news articles** using TensorFlow, employing advanced text vectorization and an LSTM-based RNN model for accurate predictions.

**Key Details:**
- **Objective**: Detect and classify fake news articles with high accuracy.
- **Data**: News articles preprocessed using `pandas` for cleaning and formatted for model training.
- **Model**: An LSTM-based RNN model built with TensorFlow, designed for text classification tasks.
- **Output**: The model classifies articles as real or fake based on textual input.
